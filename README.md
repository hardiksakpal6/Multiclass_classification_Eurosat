# Welcome to EUROSAT Multiclass Classification Project üåçüõ∞Ô∏è
Overview
This project aims to perform multiclass classification on the EUROSAT dataset using machine learning techniques. The EUROSAT dataset is a collection of satellite images covering various land uses in Europe. The goal is to classify these images into different land cover classes such as forests, urban areas, agricultural land, etc.

Requirements
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (or any other preferred deep learning framework)
Dataset
The EUROSAT dataset consists of satellite images with 10 different land cover classes. Each image is 64x64 pixels with 13 spectral bands. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the dataset, including resizing images, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
Model Building: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Neural Network) on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Fine-tuning (optional): Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques to improve performance.
Deployment (optional): Deploy the trained model for inference on new data, either as a standalone application or integrated into a larger system.
